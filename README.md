## My Projects:
[Data Science Professional Practice (Student Performance Prediction]([https://bpp0322151.github.io/dspp4/])

It looks like the hyperlink syntax is incorrect, which is why it’s not working. In Markdown, the correct format is:

    URL

Your current link has an extra `[URL]` inside it. Here’s the corrected version:

    https://bpp0322151.github.io/dspp4/

If you paste that into your Markdown file or editor, it should work properly.

Do you want me to also show you **how to embed this in HTML** or **fix multiple links in a document**?
